                        <p>
                            In an effort to keep the dynmap clean, map art must be placed over the ice in the far north/south 
                            sections of the map. Excessively gory, pornographic or generally inappropriate map art is not allowed.

                        <p>
                            To remain consistent throughout the entire server, please capitalize your town and nation names on 
                            creation. If your town or nation has a space in it's name, use the underscore character (ex. New_York). 
                            SandbloxMC staff will manually change any incorrectly formatted town or nation names if you do not do 
                            it yourself.
